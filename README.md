# Project 2: Tableau Interactive Dashboard
This project is my second portfolio piece in Data Analysis, providing hands-on experience with Tableau Public and data visualization. The goal was to clean, integrate, and transform the data into an interactive dashboard, providing insights into customer satisfaction, trends, and geographic breakdowns.

**Data Sources:**
- "British Airways Review" CSV file
- "Country Mapping" CSV file

**Key Actions Taken in the Project:**
- Raw data was collected in CSV format.
- CSV Datasets was cleaned, preprocessed and merged into one final Excel file.
- Average ratings of the services provided by the airline were created in Tableau.
- Filters were created in Tableau to visualize reviews based on the type of service provided by the airline, the review date, seat type, traveller type, aircraft type and the passenger's continent of origin.
- Graphs illustrating the country of origin of reviewers, changes in ratings over time and reviews based on aircraft type and the number of reviews were created in Tableau.
- An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize key insights, allowing users to filter and explore data related to airline services.
- The final Tableau dashboard was published on Tableau Public and the cleaned datasets were shared on GitHub for public access and further analysis.
